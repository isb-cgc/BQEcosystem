  "description": "This dataset contains the static versioned Cancer Targetome downloaded from https://github.com/ablucher/The-Cancer-Targetome. This dataset aggregates drug-target interaction and bioactivity information for FDA-approved antineoplastic drugs across four publicly available resources. It includes putative target interactions encompassing multiple targets for each antineoplastic drug and introduces a framework for categorizing the supporting evidence behind each drug-target interaction.
