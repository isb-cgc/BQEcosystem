  "description": "This dataset is a compilation of GDC file metadata generated by querying the GDC \"cases\" and \"files\" APIs. The tables in this dataset capture the information necessary to explain the relationships between all the files associated with a case ID (eg. sample barcodes, aliquot barcodes). The tables within this data set are dynamic and update with new releases; for static tables use GDC_case_file_metadata_versioned."
