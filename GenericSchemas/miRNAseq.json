  "description": "Data was extracted from {---tag-release---} of the active GDC archive in {---tag-extracted-month-year---} for {---tag-program---} microRNA sequencing data. The miRNA expression data was originally generated by next generation sequencing runs and quantified using the GDC miRNAseq analysis pipeline. Expression values are measured in total read_count as well as reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped.
