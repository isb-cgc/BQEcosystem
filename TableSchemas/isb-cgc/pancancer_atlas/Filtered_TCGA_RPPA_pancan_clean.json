Contains normalized and batch corrected data of protein concentration.  \nNote: the data was extracted from the BigQuery Table isb-cgc:pancancer_atlas.TCGA_RPPA_pancan_clean. The data is annotated with pertinent TCGA Barcodes, and participants were subsequently filtered using the PanCancer Atlas whitelist (table Whitelist_ParticipantBarcodes ) \n\nMore details:  BigQuery table: isb-cgc:pancancer_atlas.PanCancer_TCGA_RPPA_pancan_clean \nand https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/PanCan-CellOfOrigin.
