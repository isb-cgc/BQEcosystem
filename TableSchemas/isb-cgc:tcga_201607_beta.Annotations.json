More details: The TCGA annotations table is no longer available but documentation describing the annotations is available on the NCI wiki: https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/Introduction+to+Annotations. The contents of this table were downloaded shortly before the TCGA DCC went off-line. Please refer to the Genomic Data Commons Data Portal (https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/) as the new data source for TCGA data (including annotations).",
