  "description": "Data was extracted from TCGA DCC on February 2017. RPPA/protein quantification data for TCGA samples was extracted by the NCI GDC in the legacy archive specifically the files with names like \"MDA_RPPA_Core.protein_expression.Level_3\".  Note: A significant amount of manual curation of the gene and protein symbols was done. More details: https://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/public-software/tcpa/",
