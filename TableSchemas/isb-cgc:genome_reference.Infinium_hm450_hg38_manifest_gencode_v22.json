  "description": "Data was loaded from the extensive characterization of probes on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray, in September 2018. The data is based on the file http://zwdzwd.io/InfiniumAnnotation/20180909/hm450/hm450.hg38.manifest.gencode.v22.tsv.gz. Note that column \"gene_HGNC\", which in the original table contains a semi-colon delimited string, has been denormalized in this table, so that each row includes a reference to only one gene, and methylation probes that are in/near multiple genes will have some information repeated on multiple rows. More details: see Zhou W, Laird PW and Shen H, Comprehensive characterization, annotation and innovative use of Infinium DNA Methylation BeadChip probes, Nucleic Acids Research 2017 https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/4/e22/2290930.
